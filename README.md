# Welcome!!  This is my example code directory

A place where I can store my Python code as I learn and play around with the language.

The files in this repository are:

A class called WeatherReader, which reads in temperature data, humidity data, or both and checks that the data has 24hrs worth of values;

A class called DictionarBuilder, which builds a dictionary of weather classes and date values.  The class performs a K-means analysis on the data using a Euclidian distance formula.

A class called Plotting Tools, which creates two plots of weather data (temperature and humidity).

Unfortunately, I can't supply the data file for this code since it is proprietary data.  I will have to download or create a data set to be used with these classes so people can play around with them.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub site!
