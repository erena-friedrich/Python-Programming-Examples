# Welcome!!  This is my example code directory
A place where I can store my Python code as I learn and play around with the language.

There is only one file in this repository, currently, as I get my GitHub site up and running.  The two main pieces of code in the file are:

A class called WeatherReader, which reads in temperature data, humidity data, or both and checks that the data has 24hrs worth of values;

A class called DictionarBuilder, which builds a dictionary of weather classes and date values.  The class performs a K-means analysis on the data using a Euclidian distance formula.

Unfortunately, I can't supply the data file for this code since it is proprietary data.  I will have to download or create a data set to be used with these classes so people can play around with them.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub site!
